# Philosophy

This is 100% engineered by human creativity.  
No generative search(llm) is used to develop this.  

Coding this from scratch:  
- The joy of seeing it come to life is palpable and stays with me.
- The wisdom I've gained so far is priceless.
- I can explain the story of each commit and why I made those decisions.
