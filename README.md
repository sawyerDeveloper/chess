100% engineered by human creativity.  
No generative search(llm) was used in any way to develop this.  

Coding this from scratch:  
- The joy of seeing it come to life is palpable and everlasting.  
- The wisdom I've gained so far is priceless.
- I can explain the story of each commit and why I made those choices.
- I can turn my original code into a library or a product.
